# RedBot Landing Page

You've created a wonderful chatbot, but no one can find it on the search engines? **That's because you don't have a landing page.**
Create a landing page for your chatbot with few clicks:

![Landing page](https://dashboard.red-bot.io/assets/02434325-cc36-4b5b-8b95-005ccaa3b579)

Open **Mission Control** and add a title, a few eye-catching lines to describe your bot, some prompts as an example of conversation with it and, if you want, a full list of features. All without writing a single line of HTML code.

**Changelog**
